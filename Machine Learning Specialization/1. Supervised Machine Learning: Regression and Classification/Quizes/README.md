# Practice quiz: Regression

- For linear regression, the model is f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b

Which of the following are the inputs, or features, that are fed into the model and with which the model is expected to make a prediction?

```x```

- For linear regression, if you find parameters ww and bb so that J(w,b)J(w,b) is very close to zero, what can you conclude?

```The selected values of the parameters ww and bb cause the algorithm to fit the training set really well.```
